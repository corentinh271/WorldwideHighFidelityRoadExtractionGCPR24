## Custom dataset splits

Due to the lack of public test or validation sets for some of the datasets we used in our experiments, we split the data ourselves into custom training, validation and test sets (cf. Section 3 in the paper). The images belonging to each set are given in `datasets_splits.json` for each dataset as an image ID. The image prefixes and suffixes may slightly differ from the original images due to modifications made for clarity on our end, but each unique ID remains as distributed by the respective authors.
